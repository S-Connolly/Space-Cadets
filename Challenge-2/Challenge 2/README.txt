How to use: 
-Place the code in the bb.txt file
-The program runs through the code line by line and outputs the current instruction follwed by the values of all variables after the instruction has been executed
-When an iteration of a while loop has been completed, "end" will be output
-The program will output "End of code" after the last instruction has been executed

Note: 
-The interpreter assumes that the code is written correctly (i.e. all correct syntax is used and variables are initialised to 0 with clear before attempting to use them elsewhere)
-If decr is applied to a variable already at the value of 0, it will remain at 0 as negative values are not allowed in Bare Bones
